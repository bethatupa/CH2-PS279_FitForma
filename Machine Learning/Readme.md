## Documentation
- The Datasets are gathered from kaggle
- Dataset amount of each type is then adjusted and placed in the right folders to make sure the model is trained evenly (70-100 training data, 20 validation data and 10 test data)
- The model we have is our own custom created model
- We then readjusted the dataset and removed/changed some images of the dataset to add images that are more focused on the specific foods or toppings (ex: *nasi goreng polos* and *nasi goreng udang*). New images for the dataset are taken from Google images 
- We also then readjusted the model to get a satisfactory result
